## Clipboard

Cut/Copy/Paste and [Drag/drop](dragdrop.md) are based on the same XML clipboard format. For example, you can drag a node
out of XML Notepad and into any editor that supports a text clipboard format and its the same as doing a Cut & Paste
operation.

The clipboard format is the XML serialization of the selected node plus any namespace declarations needed to make that
fragment well formed.

When XML is pasted from the clipboard (or dropped) onto the [tree view](overview.md) the namespace declarations are
matched with what is in the target document already and normalized accordingly. This ensures your document doesn't
sprout lots of redundant namespace declarations as a side effect of these editing operations.
